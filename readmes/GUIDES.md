The first two videos are the shortest and best guides for support cards. In general understanding even half of a Seriru's video is useful. There are other content creators out there that are comparable to Seriru but have better English. Victoria Frontier and Rednu are the first two that pop to mind, who take care not to lead people wrong and acknowledge their mistakes when they make them.
If you want something more detailed than strong/mid/weak explanation, you have to learn about the stats of the cards.
