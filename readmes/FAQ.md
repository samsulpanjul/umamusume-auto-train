## Checklist for reporting a bug / asking for help, so that we have more of an understanding of your problem:
- **At what point do you need help?** (Installation / Running / Crashing)
  - Describe it as best you can.
- **Are you using Steam or Android Emulator?**
  - If emulator, which one?
- **Have you copied or screenshotted your logs when the error happened?**
  - We can use these to identify your problem faster and help you faster.
- **What is the version of the bot?**
  - Should be shown in the UI next to Uma Auto Train title, if there's no version, branch name is helpful.
- **Have you described your problem as well as you can?**
  - :cry:  Bad:  `I need help, bot broken`
  - :smile: Good: `The bot crashes when it goes into the training screen. Here’s my logs from that time and I have checked the checklist.`
